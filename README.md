# Assignments
In this, all the assignments of backend technology subject will be stored

Setup Codespace named Assignments by watching the recorded lecture. 
Created a web api named CalculatorAPI.
Just get to know that when creating CalculatorAPI "touch global.json" is working for linux and Mac users only

at around 1:25pm hit the wrong command "$dotnet new api --use-controller". It hsould be webapi instead of an api only.

at 1:31pm deleted weatherforecast files from controllers and repository.

at 1:48 pm stopped and video lecture is paused at 1:15:35.
