# Assignments
In this, all the assignments of backend technology subject will be stored

Setup Codespace named Assignments by watching the recorded lecture. 
Created a web api named CalculatorAPI.
Just get to know that when creating CalculatorAPI "touch global.json" is working for linux and Mac users only

at around 1:25pm hit the wrong command "$dotnet new api --use-controller". It hsould be webapi instead of an api only.

at 1:31pm deleted weatherforecast files from controllers and repository.

at 1:48 pm stopped and video lecture is paused at 1:15:35.

on 1st feb 2024 at 7:30 pm encountered the following error
error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'string'

tried https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0029
and found that forgot to change the return statement on other methods....solved at 7:45 pm

Assignment is done at 8:25 pm with all necessary changes.
